# Prerequisites

1. [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)\*
1. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

---

- For Mac users, [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/) engine also installs docker compose environment, so no need to install it separately.

## Hardware

Benchmarks are run on an AWS `c6i.4xlarge` and recommend collators have generally the same [reference hardware specified by Parity for Validators](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#reference-hardware).

Non-Collator nodes may have less power, but low memory configurations may lead to out of memory errors.

# Build

## Local Desktop

1. Install Rust using the [official instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Check out this repository
3. `rust-toolchain.toml` specifies the standard toolchain to use. If you have `rustup` installed, it will automatically install the correct toolchain when you run any cargo command.
4. Running `make check` will run cargo checks for all Frequency features. This is the recommended way to check your code before committing. Alternatively, you can run following for specific features:

   ```sh
   make check-no-relay
   make check-local
   make check-testnet
   make check-mainnet
   ```

5. Build [Wasm](https://webassembly.org) and native code.

   _Note, if you get errors complaining about missing
   dependencies (protobuf, cmake, yarn, node, jq, etc.) install them with your favorite package
   manager(e.g. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS) and re-run the command again._

   ```sh
   rustup update
   cargo clean
   make build
   ```

   Above will build Frequency with all features. Alternatively you may run following command to build with specific features:

   ```sh
   make build-no-relay
   make build-local
   make build-testnet
   make build-mainnet
   ```

   To build local, paseo (testnet) or mainnet features respectively.

At this point you should have `./target/debug` directory generated locally with compiled project files. (or `./target/release` for `make build-*-release`)

### asdf Support

Frequency optionally supports [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) for managing dependencies of the following tools:
Install the required plugins for [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com):
Please note that if you use rustup, asdf may conflict and cause issues. It is recommended to use one or the other, but not both for rust.

```sh
asdf plugin-add rust
asdf plugin-add make
asdf plugin-add cmake https://github.com/srivathsanmurali/asdf-cmake.git
```

Install the dependency versions declared in `.tool-versions`

```sh
asdf install
```

NOTE: asdf does not support clang and it needs to be installed separately.

## Remote Instance such as AWS EC2

For remote instances running Linux, if you want to check out and build such as on an [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2) instance, the process is slightly different to what is in the [Substrate documentation](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/install/linux/).

### Ubuntu

1. Upgrade the instance and install missing packages with `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt upgrade git
sudo apt install â€”-assume-yes build-essential
sudo apt install --assume-yes clang curl libssl-dev cmake
```

2. Follow [official instructions to install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), but select `3. customize the installation`, then reply **n** to `Modify PATH variable? (Y/n)`
3. Follow steps 6-10 at [Substrate: Linux development](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/install/linux/)
4. Proceed with checking out and building Frequency as above.

# Run

There are 2 options to run the chain locally:

_Note, Running Frequency via following options does not require binary to be built or chain specs to be generated separately, and is programmed within the scripts for simplicity._

1.  Collator Node without a relay chain (in manual/instant/interval sealing mode)
2.  Collator Node with a local relay chain

## 1. Collator Node without a Relay Chain

![](docs/images/local-dev-env-option-1.jpg)

This option runs just one collator node without the need for a relay chain.

This preloads into genesis all the schemas from mainnet.
Use `make genesis-schemas` if the genesis is out of date.

### Manual Sealing

a. Blocks can be triggered by calling the `engine_createBlock` RPC

```sh
curl http://localhost:9944 -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d   '{ \
    "jsonrpc":"2.0", \
    "id":1, \
    "method":"engine_createBlock", \
    "params": [true, true] \
    }'
```

b. Use the "start-manual" make target to call the RPC
Great for testing multiple items in the same block or other block formation tests.

```sh
make start-manual
```

### Instant Sealing

Same as Manual Sealing, but will also automatically trigger the formation of a block whenever a transaction is added to the validated transaction pool.
Great for most testing.

```sh
make start
```

Also available as a Docker image: [`frequencychain/standalone-node`](https://hub.docker.com/r/frequencychain/standalone-node)

```sh
docker run --rm -p 9944:9944 frequencychain/standalone-node
```

To stop running chain hit [Ctrl+C] in terminal where the chain was started.

### Interval Sealing

This sealing mode will automatically trigger the formation of a block at a specified interval (default is every 12 seconds.)

```sh
make start-interval
```

## 2. Collator Node with Local Relay Chain

![](docs/images/local-dev-env-option-2.jpg)

### Mixed Terminal/Docker

This option runs two collator nodes as local host processes and two relay chain validator nodes, each in its own docker container.

1. Start relay chain validator nodes.

   ```sh
   make start-paseo-relay
   ```

1. Register a new parachain slot (parachain id) for Frequency. _Note, if parachain was
   previously registered on a running relay chain and no new registration is required,
   then you can skip the above step._

   ```sh
   make register
   ```

1. Start Frequency as parachain with a single collator.

   ```sh
   make start-paseo-collator-alice
   ```
   ```sh
   make start-paseo-collator-bob
   ```

1.  Generate genesis/wasm and onboard Frequency to the relay chain.
   ```sh
   make onboard
   ```

#### Stop and Clean Environment

1. Off-board Frequency from relay chain: `make offboard`
2. To stop Frequency running in the terminal: `[Ctrl+C] `
3. Stop the relay chain. `make stop-relay`
4. Run to remove unused volumes. `make docker-prune`
5. Clean up temporary directory to avoid any conflicts with next onboarding:
   `rm -fr /tmp/frequency`

### All in Docker Container

This option runs one collator node and two relay chain validator nodes, each in its own docker container.

Start:

```sh
make run-frequency-docker
```

Stop:

```sh
make stop-frequency-docker
```
or:
```sh
make stop-frequency-docker-prune # to remove associated Docked volumes
```

## Run Tests

```sh
# Run all the tests
make test
# Activate selected features
cargo test --features frequency
```

### E2E Tests

To run the end-to-end tests, run `make e2e-tests`.

## Run Benchmarks

```sh
make benchmarks
```

## Run with offchain features

```sh
make start-frequency-with-offchain
```

# Format, Lint and Audit Source Code

- Format code with `make format` according to style guidelines and configurations in `rustfmt.toml`.
- Lint code with `make lint` to catch common mistakes and improve your [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) code.

  \_Note, if you get errors complaining about the wasm build, then you may need to install
  the wasm target for rust. You can do this with `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`

- Alternatively, run `make format-lint` to run both at the same time.
- Run `make lint-audit` to audit `Cargo.lock` files with `cargo-deny` for crates with security vulnerabilities reported to the [RustSec Advisory Database](https://rustsec.org). [See cargo-deny installation instructions](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny)

# Runtime

## Verify Runtime

1. Check out the commit at which the runtime was built.
2. Use [srtool](https://github.com/paritytech/srtool) and [srtool-cli](https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-cli) to verify the runtime:
   ```sh
   SRTOOL_TAG="1.84.1" srtool build \
           --build-opts="'--features on-chain-release-build,no-metadata-docs,frequency'" \
           --profile=release \
           --package=frequency-runtime \
           --root
   ```

## Local Runtime Upgrade

To upgrade the runtime, run the following command:

### Local Relay Chain

```sh
make upgrade-local
```

### Standalone Chain (No Relay)

```sh
make upgrade-no-relay
```
