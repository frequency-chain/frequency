/// Yet, it can be used for any other sort of change to weight-fee. Some examples being:
///   - Setting it to `0` will essentially disable the weight fee.
///   - Setting it to `1` will cause the literal `#[weight = x]` values to be charged.

/// Warning: Changing this function will also change the static capacity weights.
