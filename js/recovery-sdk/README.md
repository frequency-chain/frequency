# Recovery SDK for Frequency Recovery System

Support for generating and validating the hashes needed to use the Recovery System on Frequency.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

- `npm install @frequency-chain/recovery-sdk`

### React Native

To use this with React Native, you will need to shim `crypto.getRandomValues`.
[`react-native-get-random-values`](https://github.com/LinusU/react-native-get-random-values) is suggested.

## Usage

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `generateRecoverySecret` | Generates a new Recovery Secret, formatted for users |
| `getRecoveryCommitment` | Gets the Recovery Commitment for the given Recovery Secret and contact |
| `getIntermediaryHashes` | Gets the Intermediary Recovery Hashes for the Recovery Provider to use to recover |
| `getRecoveryCommitmentFromIntermediary` | Gets the Recovery Commitment from the Intermediary Recovery Hashes |

## Upgrades and Matching Versions

`@frequency-chain/recovery-sdk` is versioned with Frequency and should work against any release version of a Frequency node that has a compatible recovery system.
If you are working against a development node that has changes in the recovery system, you should match the package version against the commit hash using `v0.0.0-[First 6 of the commit hash]`.

Changelog is maintained in the [releases for Frequency](https://github.com/frequency-chain/frequency/releases).
