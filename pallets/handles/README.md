# Handles Pallet

Creates human-readable, homoglyph attack resistent handles for MSA.

## Summary

Provides MSAs with an optional, but unique handle.
The handles are able to be

- **Base Handle:** The user's chosen handle string. It is not guaranteed to be unique.
- **Suffix:** A suffix is a unique numeric value appended to a handle's canonical base to make it unique.
- **Display Handle:** The base and the suffix together (`base`.`suffix`) is a unique identifier for a user.


### UTF-8 Support

Handles are able to have many allowed ranges of UTF-8.
Some ranges, such as emoji, are currently not allowed.
Due to the handling of homoglyphs, some handles will resolve to the same value.
For example, while the display may have diacriticals, the handle is stored without diacriticals.
So `Zoë` and `Zoe` would resolve to the same handle.

### Homoglyph Attack Resistence

Two or more characters appear the same to the user are [homoglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoglyph).
To prevent most homoglyph attachs where one user attempts to impersonate another, the user's Base Handle is converted to a canonical version of the handle.
The canonical version determines the suffix series that is chosen.
Thus `alice` and `a1ice` (with a one instead of an `L`) can never have the same suffix.


### Actions

The Handles pallet provides for:

- Unique identifier for an MSA
- Creation by proxy
- Tokenless handle removal
- Shuffled sequences for Suffixes

### State Queries

Note: RPC use is suggested over the direct state queries for handles.

| Name      | Description         | Query                    | Runtime Added |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| Get Handle by MSA Id  | Returns the Display Handle and the block it was claimed   | `msaIdToDisplayName` | 29             |
| Get MSA Id by Canonical and Suffix  | Uses the stored canonical lookup string NOT the display handle with the suffix to retrieve the MSA Id   | `canonicalBaseHandleAndSuffixToMSAId` | 29             |

See the [Rust Docs](https://frequency-chain.github.io/frequency/pallet_handles/pallet/storage_types/index.html) for additional state queries and details.

### RPCs

Note: May be restricted based on node settings and configuration.
