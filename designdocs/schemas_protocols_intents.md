# üìò Design Discussion: Schema, Protocols, and Intent-Based Delegation in Frequency

## 0. **Work in Progress** <a id="section_0"></a>

Note: This document is a work in progress; specific implementation details and code examples exhibited herein are for
illustrative purposes only. Once the various questions and concerns surfaced by this "pre-design" document have be
answered satisfactorily, the document will be updated and expanded to include specific details related to the proposed
implementation.

## 1. **Background and Motivation** <a id="section_1"></a>

In the current implementation, schemas are registered with immutable numeric identifiers (`SchemaId`) and describe the
layout and storage semantics (e.g., Avro/Parquet formats, on-chain/off-chain storage). These schema IDs are used as
references by clients and runtime modules alike, particularly in the delegation system defined by the `msa` pallet.

Delegations currently allow a user to authorize a provider (e.g., an app or service) to act on their behalf, but this
authorization is tightly bound to a specific `SchemaId`. This model has proven limiting in several ways:

- **Coupling between schema versions and delegations**
- **Schemas represent data format, not purpose**
- **Lack of human-readable context**
- **Rigid governance workflows**
- **No concept of publisher authority**

These limitations have motivated a re-architecture of the schema and delegation systems to introduce the concepts of:

- **Named schemas** with version tracking
- **Structured publishing under protocols**
- **Intent-based delegation**
- **More expressive APIs and storage models**

## 2. **Design Goals** <a id="section_2"></a>

This section outlines the key objectives that guide the redesign of Frequency's schema and delegation architecture.

- **Schema Immutability** - Individual schema versions, once published, are immutable on-chain
- **Protocol-Based Versioning**
- **Minimal Delegation Churn** - Minor changes to data formats should not require new delegations
- **Minimal Storage Churn (migrations)** - Minor changes to storage formats should not require mass migration of user
  data
- **Intent Separation** - When permissioning, we need to be able to separate the purpose of the data and action from its
  format
- **Scoped Delegations** - Delegations should be able to target either a specific schema version or a complete
  schema
- <strike>**Protocol Ownership and Governance**</strike> - This feature is deferred to a future design enhancement
- **On-Chain Efficiency** - On-chain operations need to be efficient, so storage and structures must be designed with
  that in mind

## 3. Glossary of Terms <a id="section_3"></a>

- **Protocol** - the top level of the tripartite nomenclature _protocol.intent@version_ (ex: _dsnp_ is the protocol in
  _dsnp.broadcast@v2_)
- **Intent** - the second level of _protocol.intent@version_ (ex: _dsnp.broadcast_ resolves to a specific `Intent`).
  Intents should always be referred to by their fully-qualified name (ie, _dsnp.broadcast_, not just _broadcast_).
  Intents represent some meaning or purpose that may be delegated, and may optionally be associated with one or more
  _minor_ versions of a `Schema`
- **version** \[optional] - the third level of _protocol.schema@version_, resolves to a specific _minor_
  iteration of a Schema
- **Schema** - A `Schema` represents a particular data format, along with additional metadata about its location, etc

## 4. **Intents and Versioning** <a id="section_4"></a>

Intents are not just organizational tools‚Äîthey enable meaningful delegation. In the new model, an Intent is a
first-class on-chain entity. It can represent a single action or permission that may be delegated; it can optionally
reference a list of Schemas that comprise minor version updates of a particular data format--in the latter case, the
implied
permission is `schema.Write`that represents a named and versioned group of _schema versions_. Every published schema
version is
assigned to an Intent, and new versions of a schema simply add new schema version IDs to the Intent's version history.

### üìå Intent Metadata Structure

- `IntentId`: A unique numeric identifier for runtime efficiency
- `ProtocolId`: Which Protocol owns this Intent
- `IntentId`: Compact numeric ID used on-chain
- `Name`: Human-readable name (e.g., `broadcast`)
- `Description`: Optional developer-facing documentation
- `Link`: Optional link to spec or docs
- `RegisteredBy`: MSA (ProviderId) that registered the intent
- `RegisteredAt`: Block number
- `Versions`: Ordered list of `SchemaId`s (e.g., `[7, 15, 27]`, for versions 0..2)

### üß¨ Versioning Rules

- Versions are stored in a monotonic, gapless array
- A new SchemaId is automatically assigned the next version
- Older versions are preserved permanently
- Delegations may apply to the Intent, not a specific schema version ID
- _Question: can versions be deprecated?_

### üß≠ Governance Rules

- Intents must be approved by governance, and are immutable except for appending new SchemaIds to the version list
- New Schemas must be approved by governance
- Minor Schema updates (semantic-preserving format changes, etc) may be approved for the same Intent
- Major updates (change in meaning or semantics, or significant breaking format change) require publishing under a new
  Intent

## 5. **Protocols** <a id="section_5"></a>

In order to provide organizational control for schemas and intents, we introduce the concept of **Protocols**.

A Protocol (e.g., `dsnp`, `bsky`) serves as a root authority under which Schemas and Intents are registered.
Protocols allow for Intents and Schemas with similar meaning or structure, but different purposes, to be delegated
in a scoped manner. For example, there could be both a 'dsnp.broadcast' and a 'bsky.broadcast' Intent; both have similar
meaning ('broadcast a message'), but the Protocol differentiates between broadcasting a DSNP message vs an AT Protocol (
ie, Bluesky) message.

### üìõ Protocol Structure

Each protocol is a unique identifier, typically human-readable (e.g., `"dsnp"`), mapped to an on-chain `ProtocolId` (
e.g., `ProtocolId = 2`).

- Every Intent must be published under a protocol: `protocol.schema`

### ‚öôÔ∏è Protocol Governance

- **Creation of a new protocol** must be approved via governance.
- Protocols are immutable once registered

## 6. **Delegation Semantics** <a id="section_6"></a>

Delegation is the mechanism by which a user authorizes a provider to act on their behalf. Currently, this is limited to
individual `SchemaId`s, but we propose expanding the delegation model to include one or more of the following:

- Delegation by `SchemaId` (existing/legacy, for future deprecation)
- Delegation by `IntentId` (implies all schema versions within the Intent)

Both modes may coexist, allowing for graceful migration and flexible usage.

The Delegation model would go from:

```rust
// current
pub struct Delegation {
    pub revoked_at: BlockNumber,
    pub schema_permissions: BoundedBTreeMap<SchemaId, BlockNumber, MaxSchemaGrantsPerDelegation>,
}
```

to

```rust
pub enum DelegationTarget {
    Schema(SchemaId),
    Intent(IntentId),
}

pub struct DelegationInfo {
    pub entity: DelegationTarget,          // SchemaVersion, Schema, or Intent(+Protocol Namespace)
    pub revoked_at: Option<BlockNumber>,   // Replaces `expiration` and `revoked`
    pub granted_at: BlockNumber,
}

pub struct Delegation {
    pub revoked_at: BlockNumber,
    pub delegated_targets: BoundedVec<DelegationInfo, MaxTargetsPerDelegation>,
}
```

This unified structure supports flexibility while maintaining clear access logic.
Note, this storage format approximately doubles the storage requirement for delegations (from a max of ~180 bytes per
MSA/Provider currently, to a max of ~360 bytes for the same number of delegations). However, this size differential is
not due to the architectural difference in the storage structure, but rather the fact that we've chosen to store
additional information (`granted_at` block number) that we previously did not retain, and has been noted as a deficiency
of the current Delegation storage model. If we choose _not_ to correct that deficiency, the storage impact of this
architectural change is minimal (~30-byte increase per MSA/Provider for the maximum number of delegations)

## 9. **Authorization Resolution Model** <a id="section_9"></a>

This section outlines how delegation is verified at the time of an extrinsic call or message submission. In the current
model, permissions are evaluated by a specific `SchemaId`. In the new model, the runtime will evaluate permissions based
on an `IntentId`. This delegation model will entail either:

- 1-2 additional storage reads to determine the Intent associated with a given `SchemaId`, or
- New extrinsics that require `IntentId` to be supplied in addition to `SchemaId`

It will also require a storage migration to convert all existing Schema delegations to Intent delegations.

NOTE: It is also possible, without additional effort, to preserve the existing ability to delegate by `SchemaId`
directly, perhaps with a scheduled deprecation at a later date.

### üß™ Additional Considerations

- In the future, extrinsics may support intent-based authorization **without referencing a schema** at all. These would
  rely solely on explicit `IntentId`.
- SDKs should provide helpers for intent resolution and delegation explanation.

## 10. **On-Chain Data Structures** <a id="section_10"></a>

This section outlines the proposed on-chain data structures to support protocols, schemas, intents, and delegation
ownership in the redesigned Frequency architecture.

### üß± Design Principles

- On-chain runtime operations should only work with compact numeric identifiers (`SchemaId`, `IntentId`, `ProtocolId`)
- Human-readable names must be resolved by the client prior to calling extrinsics
- Delegations are unified under a single structure, regardless of type
- Minimize storage duplication and unnecessary indices

----------

### üß© Delegation Structures

```rust
// NOTE: DelegationTarget is not needed if we eliminate Schema-based delegation via a storage migration
pub enum DelegationTarget {
    Schema(SchemaId),
    Intent(IntentId),
}

pub struct DelegationInfo {
    pub entity: DelegationTarget,          // NOTE, can be reduced to simply `IntentId` if delegation by Schema is deprecated
    pub revoked_at: Option<BlockNumber>,
    pub granted_at: BlockNumber,
}

pub struct Delegation {
    pub revoked_at: BlockNumber,
    // NOTE: If we eliminate DelegationTarget for IntentId, we can easily restore the current implmentation's
    // BoundedBTreeMap implementation for additional runtime efficiency
    pub delegated_targets: BoundedVec<DelegationInfo, MaxTargetsPerDelegation>,
}

pub type Delegations<T> = StorageDoubleMap<
    _, Blake2_128Concat, MsaId,       // Delegator
    Blake2_128Concat, ProviderId,     // Provider
    Delegation,
>;
```

This structure handles all types of delegations (schema, intent) uniformly. Legacy `SchemaId` delegation
can optionally remain supported, with intent-based delegation layered on top.

----------

### üè∑ Intents and Protocols

```rust
pub type ProtocolInfos<T> = StorageMap<
    _, Blake2_128Concat, ProtocolId, ProtocolInfo
>;

// Question: should we have a map of ProtocolId => Owner

pub type Protocols<T> = StorageMap<
    _, Blake2_128Concat, ProtocolId,
    BoundedVec<SchemaId, MaxSchemasPerProtocol>
>;

pub type Intents<T> = StorageMap<
    _, Blake2_128Concat, IntentId,
    BoundedVec<SchemaVersionId, MaxVersionsPerSchema>
>;

// Useful for efficient reverse-map of Schema to Intent
// needed for checking protocol delegations
pub type SchemaToIntent<T> = StorageMap<
    _, Blake2_128Concat, SchemaId, IntentId
>;
```

Note: `IntentIds` are only referenced by numeric ID. Clients must resolve names via off-chain lookup using mappings
from `ProtocolId + name ‚Üí IntentId`.

----------

### üßπ Design Simplification

The current runtime includes a top-level flag indicating whether any delegation exists between a user and provider. This
was used to shortcut delegation checks. In this model, that summary flag is dropped ‚Äî its only purpose was to optimize
for the empty case. If need be, the design can be updated to preserve this structure.

This simplification removes complexity and keeps delegation logic self-contained.

## 12. **API Identifier Handling and Resolution** <a id="section_12"></a>

The choice of identifiers in runtime and SDK APIs has significant implications for both usability and performance.
Historically, Frequency APIs used `SchemaVersionId` for delegation and data interpretation. The proposed model must
account for schemas and intents, while maintaining runtime efficiency.

### üî¢ Preferred On-Chain Identifiers

On-chain APIs and runtime logic should rely exclusively on numeric identifiers:

- `SchemaId`: Immutable and used to validate data structure
- `IntentId`: Used for intent-level delegation

String identifiers such as protocol names or intent names should never be parsed on-chain. These must
be resolved by SDKs and off-chain services (e.g., the Frequency Gateway).

### üß† Resolution Responsibility

Clients and SDKs must perform resolution of strings to IDs before invoking extrinsics. For example:

- Resolve `"dsnp.broadcast"` ‚Üí `(ProtocolId, IntentId)`

### üì¨ Extrinsic Parameters

Three possible design patterns:

1. **Submit by SchemaId only (Legacy/Compatible):**

    - Fast, direct lookup
    - Requires on-chain schema metadata to determine intent for validation
    - May require multi-delegation validation (intent or schema)

2. **Submit by SchemaId + IntentId (Explicit):**

    - Enables precision delegation checks
    - Slightly more complex client integration

3. **Submit by IntentId only (No Schema):**

    - Enables non-schema-based actions (e.g., future custom actions)
    - Runtime must validate delegation directly

### üéØ Developer Experience Considerations

- APIs should remain backward compatible with `SchemaId`-based extrinsic calls.
- Whether to expose intent-based extrinsics directly is an open question.
- SDKs such as the Frequency Gateway may offer string-based input and resolve IDs internally.

## 13. **Migration Strategy** <a id="section_13"></a>

Transitioning from the current schema delegation system to the new schema + intent model must be handled
carefully to preserve backward compatibility while enabling the new architecture to roll out incrementally.

### üß© Legacy Support

- Legacy `SchemaId`-based delegations will continue to be supported for existing providers
- Existing data using older schema versions remains valid
- Providers can continue operating without changes while the new system is phased in

### üöÄ Protocol Bootstrapping

- Governance may backfill `IntentId`s and `ProtocolId`s for existing DSNP schemas
- Each legacy schema version will be added to its corresponding schema version array
- Historical schema versions will be placed in schema version order

### üîÅ Delegation Migration

- Providers can request users re-authorize using `IntentId` delegations at their discretion
- SDK tooling may provide utilities to convert legacy schema delegations into intent equivalents

### üõë Sunset of Schema-Based Delegation (Future)

Once adoption of intent/protocol delegation is widespread:

- Chain governance may disable new schema-based delegations
- Existing schema-based delegations may be invalidated at a future block height
- Tooling will issue deprecation warnings ahead of this change

This strategy ensures a smooth, opt-in path to the new system while preserving all critical functionality during the
transition period.

## 14. **Open Questions and Next Steps** <a id="section_14"></a>

Several open questions remain that may influence the final implementation strategy and runtime behavior. These are left
intentionally unresolved to guide future design discussions within the development and governance communities.

### ‚ùì Open Questions

- Should delegation resolution allow both **schema** and **intent** types simultaneously, or require mutual
  exclusivity? Or, should only one of them be implemented at all?

- What developer-facing tools will be needed to ease migration and debugging?

- Will schema deprecation or version invalidation ever be supported, or are all published schemas permanently
  active?

### üß≠ Next Steps

1. **Internal review** of this proposal by Frequency core contributors

2. **Discussion of delegation scope models** and confirmation of preferred resolution pattern

3. **Engineering spike** into schema/intents/protocol runtime storage cost and migration

4. **API/SDK prototype** demonstrating resolution and delegation lookup UX

5. **Drafting of runtime implementation plan** and migration support utilities

6. **Call for feedback** from developers, partners, and governance stakeholders

This document serves as a foundation for these efforts and should evolve alongside prototyping and implementation
planning.
